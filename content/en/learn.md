***Welcome to learning about NumPy!***

To learn how to use NumPy, you could begin with the resources listed under the 'beginners' section. Once you have a broad view into how to get started with using NumPy, you could try the more involved tutorials and resources listed under 'advanced' section.

This is a curated collection of NumPy related educational resources. Some are very specific to NumPy, while others offer a broader view on numerical computing. It is a continuously evolving list. In case you would like to contribute, please refer to the section 'Contributing to NumPy Learning Resources' below.

## Beginners

There is tons of information about NumPy out there. If you are new to NumPy, we'd strongly recommend the following tutorials, books and videos to get started.

<i class="fad fa-chalkboard"></i> **Tutorials**

* [NumPy Quickstart Tutorial](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html)
* [SciPy Lectures](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/), Gaël Varoquaux, Emmanuelle Gouillart, Olav Vahtras et al., 2016. *Besides covering NumPy, these lectures offer a broader introduction to the scientific Python ecosystem.*
