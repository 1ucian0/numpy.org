# Community

NumPy is an open source project developed by a very diverse group of [contributors](https://numpy.org/team.md).

We offer several communication channels to learn, share your knowledge and connect with others within the NumPy community.

The NumPy leadership has made a strong commitment to creating an open, inclusive, and positive community. Please read the [NumPy Code of Conduct](https://www.numpy.org/code-of-conduct.md) for guidance on how to interact with others in a way that makes the community thrive.

## Online Communities and Social Resources

   - how should we have discussions about NumPy as software and as a community project?

   - developing or adding items to the NumPy Roadmap;

   - announcing sprints or conference talks;

   - changes to the development workflow;

   - announcements for NumPy releases and developer meetings.
