NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
It contains among other things:

- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient
multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be
defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide
variety of databases.

NumPy is licensed under the :ref:`BSD license <license>`, enabling reuse with
few restrictions.

Getting Started
---------------

To install NumPy, we strongly recommend using a
*scientific Python distribution*.  See
`Installing the SciPy Stack <https://www.scipy.org/install.html>`__ for
details.

Many high quality online tutorials, courses, and books are available to get
started with NumPy. For a quick introduction to NumPy we provide the
`NumPy Tutorial <https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html>`__. We
also recommend the `SciPy Lecture Notes <https://scipy-lectures.org>`__ for a
broader introduction to the scientific Python ecosystem.

For more information on the SciPy Stack (for which NumPy provides the
fundamental array data structure), see `scipy.org <https://www.scipy.org/>`__.

Documentation
-------------

The most up-to-date NumPy documentation can be found at
`Latest (development) version <https://www.numpy.org/devdocs>`__.  I
It includes a user guide, full reference documentation, a developer guide, meta
information, and "NumPy Enhancement Proposals" (which include the NumPy Roadmap
and detailed plans for major new features).

A complete archive of documentation for all NumPy releases (minor versions; bug
fix releases don't contain significant documentation changes) since 2009 can be
found at https://docs.scipy.org. For convenience, here are direct links to the most
recent releases:
